<p style="text-align:center;">This is an article I wrote for the Odyssey. It's about places where students can use their student I.D. and get some pretty great discounts. For this story I used social media to ask students what were some of their favorite places to use their student discount. Then I called those companies or looking at their websites to find out what kind of discounts they offer.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">This was a story I wrote for Mass Comm Week at Texas State. A panel of alumni came to campus to give advice to students on applying for jobs after college and how to prepare themselves for those careers. I also live-tweeted this event, which was something I had done once before. It was cool to practice that again and use social media as a part of journalism.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">For my media design class we had to create a 6-page magazine spread using InDesign and Photoshop. I really enjoyed using them both and figuring out all the features they comes with. This class really made me realize how much I enjoy the design and creativity aspect of journalism too.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">This was a senior journalism project about the impact of scholarships on students at Texas State University.  Over the course of the spring semester I interviewed and filmed students at the Texas State campus to learn more of just how scholarships can impact a college student. This project really taught me a lot  about interviewing and gathering information on deadlines. There is so much that I took away from this and I know that it will benefit me tremendously in the future.</p>
