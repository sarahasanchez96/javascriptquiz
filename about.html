<h2> Here's a little about me! </h2>	

<p> My name is Sarah Sanchez. I am a junior at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. I am pursuing a degree in journalism with a minor in fashion merchandising and an emphasis in digital media. </p>

<p> I have always loved writing and knew that it was something I wanted to do in my future career. However, I never knew how I could use my skills with writing and apply it to a job and career that I was passionate about. </p>

<p> My senior year of high school I decided to take a journalism class as an extra elective and immediately fell in love with it. Through that one elective class, I learned how to adapt my skills with writing, love of storytelling and constant curiosity and apply them to a degree in journalism. </p>

<p> I am now a junior in college and have learned a lot more about the journalism field since my senior year of high school. Through my courses here at Texas State I have grown as a journalist in so many ways. </p>

<p> My minor is in fashion merchandising because I have always loved fashion and beauty. Through those classes I have not only become more informed on those topics, but I have also learned a lot about business and the industry. I think that knowledge would be beneficial when writing an article about fashion or beauty.</p>

<p>I also have an emphasis in digital media. Digital media has become such a huge part of society and has grown largely in the newspaper and magazine industry. I believe that knowing those skills will help me thrive in the journalism field in so many ways. </p>

<p>My goal is to eventually work in Austin, Texas. I love the energy and excitement of Austin and would love to work for a magazine there such as Austin Woman or Austin Monthly. I am still curious about where in journalism my passion is, but I know that it is the field where I want to continue to grow and succeed in every day. </p>
